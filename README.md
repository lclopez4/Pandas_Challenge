PyCitySchools Analysis

Overview
This project analyzes standardized math and reading scores of students from multiple schools within a hypothetical district. The objective is to evaluate school performance by calculating key metrics such as passing rates, average scores, and analyzing trends based on school type, size, and spending.

The analysis was conducted using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook.

Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to:

Evaluate district and school-level academic performance.

Identify trends in performance based on school spending, size, and type.

Provide actionable insights for educational stakeholders.

Data Sources

schools_complete.csv: Contains information about each school, including name, type, and budget.

students_complete.csv: Contains student data including scores and grade level.

Scores by School Type

Performance metrics by school type (Charter vs. District)

Observable Trends

Spending vs. Performance:
Schools that spend less per student (below $585) tend to have higher average passing rates compared to the highest-spending schools, which is counterintuitive.

School Type Performance:
Charter schools generally outperform district schools in both math and reading, especially in terms of overall passing rates.
